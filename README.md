# Noita Cheat GUI
A basic in-game cheat menu. Note: if you just want to see the alchemy recipes without all the other cheat functionality, [there is a mod for that](https://github.com/probable-basilisk/alchemyrecipes).

## Installation

You can either download the mod manually or clone this Git repo into the Noita `mods` sub-directory.

### (Recommended: opt-in to the Steam beta branch of Noita)
Cheatgui is developed against, and really only tested with, the beta branch. It'll _probably_ work with the non-beta,
but it's not guaranteed.

### Download manually

[Download the release .zip](https://github.com/probable-basilisk/cheatgui/releases/download/v1.3.0/cheatgui_v1_3_0_beta.zip), 
and extract into your `Noita/mods/` directory, renaming the folder to just `cheatgui`.

**IMPORTANT**: The naming of the installation directory matters-- **this README should end up in `Noita/mods/cheatgui/README.md`**.

### (or) Clone the Git repo

You can git clone this repo directly into mods:

```
cd {your Noita install dir}/mods/
git clone https://github.com/probable-basilisk/cheatgui.git
```

**IMPORTANT**: You will need to get the `pollnet.dll` binary from the [release zip](https://github.com/probable-basilisk/cheatgui/releases/download/v1.3.0/cheatgui_v1_3_0_beta.zip), located in `bin/pollnet.dll`. You should copy this file to `Noita/mods/cheatgui/bin/pollnet.dll`.

### Enable the mod in Noita

Enable the 'cheatgui' mod through the in-game pause menu.

You will be prompted that "This mod has requested extra privileges." â€“ see the following section 'Note about scary warnings' for details.

#### Note about scary warnings

Cheatgui needs unsafe access to allow typing, and to enable the web console. If the warnings bother you, get the Steam workshop version, although
you will obviously miss out on the type-to-filter and webconsole functionality.

## Note about paths

Right now I'm having the mod put all its files into the global `data/hax/`
path rather than into the mod-specific path, both because I'm lazy, and
also because I might want to cross-load some of these files from other things.
